Do not infer, assume, or estimate details that are not explicitly visible.\n- The person's name must be extracted from the bounding box label which will be a ID like CEK21CS... If the person is labeled \"unknown\" or is unrecognized, use \"unknown\".",
    
    "Object Association Rules": "- An object belongs to a person if it is carried, held, worn (except clothing), or positioned clearly with them.\n- If an object is not clearly associated with any identified person, it should be assigned to \"unknown\".",
    
    "Object Detection Criteria": "- Identify and categorize objects only within the following predefined categories:\n  - Electronics (cell phone, laptop, keyboard, remote, mouse)\n  - Accessories (handbag, umbrella, backpack, suitcase, tie)\n  - Sports Equipment (tennis racket, sports ball)\n  - Stationery (book, scissors)\n  - miscellaneous (water bottle, cup, bowl)\n- Ignore any object outside these categories.",
    
    "Object Analysis & Description": "For each detected object, extract and report the following properties:\n1. Name (e.g., laptop, backpack, water bottle)\n2. Color (if distinguishable, use standard colors -  Black, White, Gray, Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Gold, Multicolor or No Color )\n3. Category (Electronics, Accessories, Sports, Stationery, other.)\n4. Brand (if a recognizable brand label is visible)\n5. Extra Description (only visible distinguishing features such as):\n   - Scratches, dents, stickers, labels, engravings, custom markings, unique patterns, or other identifiable features.\n   - Do not assume dimensions (e.g., weight, size) unless a label explicitly states them.",
    
    "Constraints & Additional Rules": "- Do not include clothing in the object list.\n- Strictly adhere to JSON formatâ€”no extra text, summaries, or explanations.\n- Only analyze objects that have a bounding box and a label in the image.\n- If multiple people and objects are detected, each person should be listed separately with their associated objects."
